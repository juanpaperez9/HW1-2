## Getting Started
**any questions or clarifications you would like to have asked of the client who needs this code**

How long are the student ID numbers? Whats the minimum lenght and maximum lenght?
Do you need me to do anything with the ID numbers, to store them somewhere to make it 
easier to find the student or this "App" is strictly just to swipe the ID and get attendence? 

**any design decisions or assumptions you made in order to write the code**

**Project Breakdown**
Input Handling: Design a mechanism to receive ID numbers from the swiping machine as input.

Conversion: Convert the received ID numbers into student names using a mapping or lookup table.

Storage: Store the attendance information, ensuring that each student is recorded only once per day.

Reporting: Provide a way for teachers to access and view the attendance records at the end of the day.
