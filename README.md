## Getting Started

**Project Breakdown**
Input Handling: Design a mechanism to receive ID numbers from the swiping machine as input.

Conversion: Convert the received ID numbers into student names using a mapping or lookup table.

Storage: Store the attendance information, ensuring that each student is recorded only once per day.

Reporting: Provide a way for teachers to access and view the attendance records at the end of the day.
